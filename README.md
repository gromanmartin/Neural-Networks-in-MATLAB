# Neural Networks in MATLAB

In this repo I have collected several MATLAB scripts for various types of neural networks. All of these networks were part of a school project, however I found the problem definition to only a couple of them. The definition is included in specific folders.

## Installation

No need to install any additional MATLAB packages.

## Usage
To use a specific network download the scripts in the folder and run the script with network name.
